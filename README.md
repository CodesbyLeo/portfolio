## üë∑ Disclaimers

**This is an ongoing project and it is not done yet**.
If you encounter any bugs it will be really helpfull if you could provide the origin of that bug, the browser you used and the device.

**This design was not made by me**.
All the icons, wallpaper and sounds belong to windows corporation, so there's nothing I've created here. All I did was copy and apply the design for the web.

**The music component is broken**.
It is for now "normal". I am still waiting for my spotify extension request to be approuved. That could allow users that are not on the whitelist to login to the spotify portal and use the player. I'll be working on a way to look at my playlist without the spotify API for those that do not have an account.

_(If you want to test it feel free to ask using the contact form providing your email used on your Spotify account, I will add you to the whitelist and email you back)_

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Consumption

Since WindowsXp design was not really meant to be eco friendly _(thanks to the billions of linear gradients)_
I did my best to make it as lightweight as possible.

## üé® Webdesign

The original design was made by the windows xp team, there is nothing I've done here but copying it for my use using web languages.

The design part was pretty straight forward on Figma, I used it more like a place where I could put ressources.
You can still use the components created in the Figma Design they are free and no need to quote.

I used after that the docker image of windows xp, that helps a lot to see all the small interactions there is :
